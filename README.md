# Finding-Causal-Factor-behind-Sea-Level-Rise-in-the-Bay-of-Bengal-Region
1.Conducted sea level analysis and projection for 21.25°N, 87.75°E using time series modeling. 2. Detected heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation using Breusch-Pagan, White’s, and Durbin-Watson tests. 4.Identified top causal factors and their optimal lag for sea level rise using Pearl (DoWhy) and Granger causality methods.
